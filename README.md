# Google-reCAPTCHA-v3
Perl API for Google reCAPTCHA v3

This module is not what's currently on CPAN: 

https://metacpan.org/pod/Captcha::reCAPTCHA::V3

I started this module before the CPAN version was uploaded. They do basically the same thing, although my module doesn't - and won't render any HTML. 

In the future, I may upload this as, "Google::reCAPTCHA::v3::Tiny", but I feel that's not in the best style.
